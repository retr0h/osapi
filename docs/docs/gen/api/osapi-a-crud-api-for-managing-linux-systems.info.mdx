OSAPI is a lightweight, minimalistic RESTful API designed to manage and
configure Linux systems as appliances. The API provides comprehensive
management capabilities, including reading the current state of the system
and making privileged, asynchronous changes to match a desired configuration
state.

OSAPI is built with pluggability and extensibility in mind, allowing it to
adapt to different Linux distributions and environments by implementing
custom handlers for various system operations.

Key Features:
- **RESTful API Design:** A RESTful approach for managing Linux systems,
  enabling clear and organized endpoints for system configurations,
  diagnostics, and state management.
- **Pluggable Architecture:** Easily extend or replace components to suit
  different Linux environments. This flexibility allows users to customize
  behavior based on specific distribution requirements or operational needs.
- **Task Worker for Privileged Actions:** Asynchronous task execution to
  perform system modifications securely, ensuring that changes are managed
  in a controlled and orderly manner.
- **System Information Gathering:** Provides detailed system insights, such
  as OS details, hostname, and other environment-specific information,
  facilitating diagnostics and monitoring.
- **CLI Equivalence:** All functionalities accessible via the API are also
  available through an equivalent command-line interface, making the tool
  adaptable to both programmatic and manual use cases.
- **Written in Go:** The API and its supporting tools are written in Go,
  ensuring high performance, low resource usage, and easy cross-platform
  deployment.
